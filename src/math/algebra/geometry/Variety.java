 * algebraic varieties (also called varieties) are one of the central objects of
 * study in algebraic geometry. Classically, an algebraic variety was defined to
 * be the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations, over the real or
 * complex numbers. Modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this
 * notion in several different ways, while attempting to preserve the geometric
 * intuition behind the original definition.[1]:58
 * 
 * Conventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ slightly.
 * For example, some authors require that an "algebraic variety" is, by
 * definition, irreducible (which means that it is not the union of two smaller
 * sets that are closed in the Zariski topology), while others do not. When the
 * former convention is used, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called
 * algebraic sets.
 * 
 * The notion of variety is similar to that of manifold, the difference being
 * that a variety may have singular points, while a manifold will not. In many
 * languages, both varieties and manifolds are named by the same word.
 * 
 * Proven around the year 1800, the fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a
 * link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial in one
 * variable with complex coefficients (an algebraic object) is determined by the
 * set of its roots (a geometric object). Generalizing this result, Hilbert's
 * Nullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of
 * polynomial rings and algebraic sets. Using the Nullstellensatz and related
 * results, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between
 * questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory. This correspondence
 * is the specificity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of
 * geometry.
