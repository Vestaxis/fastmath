 * A quasi-projective variety is a Zariski open subset of a projective variety.
 * Notice that every affine variety is quasi-projective.[2] Notice also that the
 * complement of an algebraic set in an affine variety is a quasi-projective
 * variety; in the context of affine varieties, such a quasi-projective variety
 * is usually not called a variety but a constructible set.
