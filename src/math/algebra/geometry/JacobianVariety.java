 * A Jacobian variety (also: Jacobian) of an algebraic curve S is a principally
 * polarized Abelian variety (cf. also Polarized algebraic variety) (J(S),Œò)
 * formed from this curve. Sometimes a Jacobi variety is simply considered to be
 * a commutative algebraic group. If S is a smooth projective curve of genus g
 * over the field ‚ÑÇ, or, in classical terminology, a compact Riemann surface of
 * genus g, then the integration of holomorphic 1-forms over the 1-cycles on S
 * defines the imbedding <code>H1(S,‚Ñ§)‚ÜíH0(S,Œ©S)‚àó</code>, the image of which is a
 * lattice of maximal rank (here Œ©S denotes the bundle of holomorphic 1-forms on
 * S). The Jacobi variety of the curve S is the quotient variety
 * <code>J(S)=H0(S,Œ©S)‚àó/H1(S,‚Ñ§).</code> For the polarization on it one can take
 * the cohomology class Œò from H1(J(S),‚Ñ§)‚àßH1(J(S),‚Ñ§)=H2(J(S),‚Ñ§)‚äÇH2(J(S),‚ÑÇ) that
 * corresponds to the intersection form on H1(S,‚Ñ§)‚âÖH1(J(S),‚Ñ§). This polarization
 * is principal, that is, Œòg=g‚Ä≤. For a more explicit definition of a Jacobi
 * variety it is usual to take a basis Œ¥1,‚Ä¶,Œ¥2g in H1(S,‚Ñ§) and a basis of forms
 * œâ1,‚Ä¶,œâg in H0(S,Œ©S). These define a (g√ó2g)-matrix Œ© - the matrix of periods
 * of the Riemann surface: Œ©=||‚à´Œ¥jœâj||. Then J(S)=‚ÑÇg/Œõ, where Œõ is the lattice
 * with basis consisting of the columns of Œ©. The bases Œ¥j and œâi can be chosen
 * so that Œ©=||EgZ||; here the matrix Z=X+iY is symmetric and Y>0 (see Abelian
 * differential). The polarization class is represented by the form œâ that, when
 * written in standard coordinates (z1,‚Ä¶,zg) in ‚ÑÇg, is
 * œâ=i2‚àë1‚â§j,k‚â§g(Y‚àí1)jkdzj‚àßdz¬Øk. Often, instead of the cohomology class Œò the
 * effective divisor dual to it is considered; it is denoted by the same letter
 * and is defined uniquely up to a translation. Geometrically, the divisor Œò can
 * be described in the following way. Consider the Abelian mapping Œº:S‚ÜíJ(S)
 * defined by Œº(s)=(‚à´ss0œâ1,‚Ä¶,‚à´ss0œâg)+Œõ, where s0‚ààS is fixed. Let S(d) be the
 * d-th symmetric power of S, that is, the quotient variety of the variety Sd
 * with respect to the symmetric group (the points of S(d) correspond to
 * effective divisors of degree d on S). The formula Œº(s1,‚Ä¶,sd)=Œº(s1)+‚ãØ+Œº(sd)
 * defines an extension of the Abelian mapping to Œº:S(d)‚ÜíJ(S). Then Œò=Wg‚àí1=J(S).
 * 
 * The equivalence relation in S(g) defined by Œº coincides with the rational
 * equivalence of divisors (Abel's theorem). In addition, Œº(S(g))=J(S) (Jacobi's
 * inversion theorem). C.G.J. Jacobi studied the inversion problem in the case
 * g=2 (see also Jacobi inversion problem). The above-mentioned theorems
 * determine an isomorphism J(S)‚âÖPicg(S), where Picg(S) is the component of the
 * Picard group Pic(S) corresponding to divisors of degree g. Multiplication by
 * the divisor class ‚àígs0 leads to a canonical isomorphism J(S)‚âÖPic0(S) of
 * Abelian varieties.
 * 
 * In the case of a complete smooth curve over an arbitrary field, the Jacobi
 * variety J(S) is defined as the Picard variety Pic(S). The Abelian mapping Œº
 * associates with a point s‚ààS the class of the divisor s‚àís0, and the
 * polarization is defined by the divisor Wg‚àí1=Œº(S(g‚àí1)).
 * 
 * The significance of Jacobi varieties in the theory of algebraic curves is
 * clear from the Torelli theorem (cf. Torelli theorems): A non-singular
 * complete curve is uniquely defined by its Jacobian (with due regard for
 * polarization) (see [Griff1]). The passage from a curve to its Jacobian
 * enables one to linearize a number of non-linear problems in the theory of
 * curves. For example, the problem of describing special divisors on S (that
 * is, effective divisors D for which H0(S,O(K‚àíD))>0) is essentially translated
 * to the language of singularities of special subvarieties Wd=Œº(S(d)) of J(S).
 * This translation is based on the Riemann‚ÄìKempf theorem about singularities
 * (see , [Griff1]). One of the corollaries of this theorem is that the
 * codimension of the variety of singular points of the divisor of the
 * polarization, Œò=Wg‚àí1, does not exceed 4. This property of Jacobi varieties is
 * characteristic if one considers only principally polarized Abelian varieties
 * belonging to a neighbourhood of the Jacobian of a general curve. More
 * precisely, if the variety of singular points of the divisor of the
 * polarization of a principally polarized Abelian variety A has codimension ‚â§4,
 * and if A does not belong to several distinguished components of the moduli
 * variety, then A‚âÖJ(S) for a smooth curve S (see [AM]).
 * 
 * Another approach to distinguishing Jacobians among Abelian varieties is to
 * define equations in Œ∏-functions and their derivatives at special points. The
 * problem of finding these equations is called Schottky's problem.
 * 
 * In the case of a singular curve S the Jacobi variety J(S) is regarded as the
 * subgroup of Pic(S) defined by divisors of degree 0 with respect to each
 * irreducible component of S (it coincides with the connected component of the
 * identity in Pic(S)). If the curve S is defined by a module ùî™ on a smooth
 * model N, then J(S) is usually called the generalized Jacobian of the curve N
 * (relative to ùî™), and is denoted by Jùî™ (see [Se]). References

 * The Schottky problem has been solved, cf. Schottky problem.
 * 
 * Here, a module on a smooth curve N is simply an effective divisor, i.e., a
 * finite set S of points of N with a positive integer ŒΩP assigned to each point
 * P‚ààS. Given a module ùî™ and a rational function g on N, one writes g‚â°1modùî™ if
 * 1‚àíg has a zero of order ‚â•ŒΩP in P for all P‚ààS. Consider divisors D whose
 * support does not intersect S. For these divisors one defines an equivalence
 * relation: D1‚àºùî™D2 if there is a rational function g such that (g)=D1‚àíD2 and
 * g‚â°1modùî™. This is the equivalence relation that serves to define the
 * generalized Jacobian Jùî™, cf. [References], Chapt. V for details. In general,
 * the generalized Jacobian is not complete; it is an extension of J(N) by a
 * connected linear algebraic group. Every Abelian extension of the function
 * field of N can be obtained by an isogeny of a generalized Jacobian. This is a
 * main reason for studying them [Se].
 * 
 * 
 * In the case of an arbitrary field the construction of the Jacobi variety J(S)
 * of a complete smooth curve S was achieved by A. Weil, first as an abstract
 * algebraic variety (see [Weil] and [Lang]), and later as a projective variety
 * by W.L. Chow (see [Chow]).
