/**
 * a motive (or sometimes motif, following French usage) denotes 'some essential
 * part of an algebraic variety'. To date, pure motives have been defined, while
 * conjectural mixed motives have not.[citation needed] Pure motives are triples
 * (X, p, m), where X is a smooth projective variety, p : X ⊢ X is an idempotent
 * correspondence, and m an integer. A morphism from (X, p, m) to (Y, q, n) is
 * given by a correspondence of degree n – m.
 * 
 * As far as mixed motives, following Alexander Grothendieck, mathematicians are
 * working to find a suitable definition which will then provide a "universal"
 * cohomology theory. In terms of category theory, it was intended to have a
 * definition via splitting idempotents in a category of algebraic
 * correspondences. The way ahead for that definition has been blocked for some
 * decades by the failure to prove the standard conjectures on algebraic cycles.
 * This prevents the category from having 'enough' morphisms, as can currently
 * be shown.[citation needed] While the category of motives was supposed to be
 * the universal Weil cohomology much discussed in the years 1960-1970, that
 * hope for it remains unfulfilled. On the other hand, by a quite different
 * route, motivic cohomology now has a technically adequate definition.
