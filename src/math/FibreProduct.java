 * TOTO: this needs attention
 * 
 * Fibre product
 * 
 * The fibre product of a system of topological spaces Xα with respect to a
 * system of continuous mappings fα:Xα→X0, α∈ is the subset X of the Tikhonov
 * product ∏α∈Xα, which is considered in the induced topology and which
 * consists of the points x={xα}∈∏α∈Xα for which fαxα=fα′xα′, for all indices α
 * and α′ from . The mapping which brings the point x={xα}∈X into
 * correspondence with the point xα∈Xα (or with the point fαxα∈X0) is called a
 * projection of the fibre product X onto Xα, α∈ (or onto X0). If the space X0
 * is a one-point space, then X≅∏α∈Xα. If the Xα, α∈, are completely-regular
 * spaces, the fibre product X is completely regular. The fibre product, in
 * particular its special case the partial product, is well suited for the
 * construction of universal (in the sense of homeomorphic inclusion)
 * topological spaces of given weight and given dimension (cf. Universal space).
 * 
 * 
 * Comments
 * 
 * In category theory the term "pullback" is also used, cf. Fibre product of
 * objects in a category.
