/**
 * Fr√©chet space is a complete metrizable locally convex topological vector
 * space. Banach spaces furnish examples of Fr√©chet spaces, but several
 * important function spaces are Fr√©chet spaces without being Banach spaces.
 * Among these are: the Schwartz space ùíÆ(‚Ñù^n) of all infinitely-differentiable
 * complex-valued functions on ‚Ñù^n that decrease at infinity, as do all their
 * derivatives, faster than any polynomial, with the topology given by the
 * system of semi-norms
 * pŒ±,Œ≤(x)=supt‚àà‚Ñùn‚à£‚à£‚à£‚à£tŒ≤11‚ãØtŒ≤nn‚àÇŒ±1+‚ãØ+Œ±nx(t1,‚Ä¶,tn)‚àÇtŒ±11‚ãØ‚àÇtŒ±nn‚à£‚à£‚à£‚à£, where Œ± and Œ≤
 * are non-negative integer vectors; the space H(D) of all holomorphic functions
 * on some open subset D of the complex plane with the topology of uniform
 * convergence on compact subsets of D, etc.
 * 
 * A closed subspace of a Fr√©chet space is a Fr√©chet space; so is a quotient
 * space of a Fr√©chet space by a closed subspace; a Fr√©chet space is a barrelled
 * space, and therefore the Banach‚ÄìSteinhaus theorem is true for mappings from a
 * Fr√©chet space into a locally convex space. If a separable locally convex
 * space is the image of a Fr√©chet space under an open mapping, then it is
 * itself a Fr√©chet space. A one-to-one continuous linear mapping from a Fr√©chet
 * space onto a Fr√©chet space is an isomorphism (an analog of a theorem of
 * Banach).
 * 
 * Fr√©chet spaces are so named in honor of M. Fr√©chet.
