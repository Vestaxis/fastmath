/**
 * Topological structure (topology)
 * 
 * open topology, respectively, closed topology
 * 
 * A collection , respectively , of subsets of a set , satisfying the following
 * properties: 1) The set , as well as the empty set , are elements of the
 * collection , respectively .
 * 
 * , respectively . The intersection, respectively union, of a finite number,
 * and the union, respectively intersection, of any number of elements of ,
 * respectively , is an element of the same collection.
 * 
 * Once a topology, or topological structure, has been introduced or defined on
 * a set , the set is called a topological space, its elements are called points
 * and the elements of the collection , respectively , are called the open,
 * respectively closed, sets of this topological space.
 * 
 * If one of the collections or of subsets of is defined, satisfying property 1
 * and or , respectively, then the other collection may be defined by duality as
 * consisting of the complements of the elements of the first collection.
