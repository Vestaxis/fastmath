/**
 * the Archimedean property, named after the ancient Greek mathematician
 * Archimedes of Syracuse, is a property held by some algebraic structures, such
 * as ordered or normed groups, and fields. Roughly speaking, it is the property
 * of having no infinitely large or infinitely small elements. It was Otto Stolz
 * who gave the axiom of Archimedes its name because it appears as Axiom V of
 * Archimedesâ€™ On the Sphere and Cylinder.[1]
 * 
 * The notion arose from the theory of magnitudes of Ancient Greece; it still
 * plays an important role in modern mathematics such as David Hilbert's axioms
 * for geometry, and the theories of ordered groups, ordered fields, and local
 * fields.
 * 
 * An algebraic structure in which any two non-zero elements are comparable, in
 * the sense that neither of them is infinitesimal with respect to the other, is
 * said to be Archimedean. A structure which has a pair of non-zero elements,
 * one of which is infinitesimal with respect to the other, is said to be
 * non-Archimedean. For example, a linearly ordered group that is Archimedean is
 * an Archimedean group.
 * 
 * This can be made precise in various contexts with slightly different ways of
 * formulation. For example, in the context of ordered fields, one has the axiom
 * of Archimedes which formulates this property, where the field of real numbers
 * is Archimedean, but that of rational functions in real coefficients is not.
