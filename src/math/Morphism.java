 * A homomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping from one mathematical
 * structure to another. The notion of morphism recurs in much of contemporary
 * mathematics. In set theory, homomorphisms are functions; in linear algebra,
 * linear transformations; in group theory, group homomorphisms; in topology,
 * continuous functions, and so on.
