/**
 * Locally compact space
 * 
 * A topological space at every point of which there is a neighbourhood with
 * compact closure. A locally compact Hausdorff space is a completely-regular
 * space. The partially ordered set of all its Hausdorff compactifications (cf.
 * Compactification) is a complete lattice. Its minimal element is the
 * Aleksandrov compactification . The class of locally compact Hausdorff spaces
 * coincides with the class of open subsets of Hausdorff compacta. For a locally
 * compact Hausdorff space its remainder in any Hausdorff compactification is a
 * Hausdorff compactum. Every connected paracompact locally compact space is the
 * sum of countably many compact subsets.
 * 
 * The most important example of a locally compact space is -dimensional
 * Euclidean space. A topological Hausdorff vector space (not reducing to the
 * zero element) over a complete non-discretely normed division ring is locally
 * compact if and only if is locally compact and is finite-dimensional over .
 * 
 * 
 * Comments
 * 
 * A product of topological spaces is locally compact if and only if each
 * separate coordinate space is locally compact and all but finitely many are
 * compact. References [a1] J.L. Kelley, "General topology" , v. Nostrand (1955)
