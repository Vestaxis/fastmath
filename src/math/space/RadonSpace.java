/**
 * * A topological space X is called a Radon space if every finite measure
 * defined on the σ-algebra (X) of Borel sets is a Radon measure. For instance
 * the Euclidean space is a Radon space (cp. with Theorem 1.11 and Corollary
 * 1.12 of [Ma]).
 * 
 * If (X) is countably generated, X is a Radon space if and only if it is Borel
 * isomorphic to a universally measurable subset of [0,1]ℕ (or any other
 * uncountable compact metrizable space). In particular, any polish space (see
 * Descriptive set theory), or more generally Suslin space (see measure) in the
 * sense of Bourbaki, is Radon. Duality with continuous functions
