 * An additive group is a group where the operation is called addition and is
 * denoted +. In an additive group, the identity element is called zero, and the
 * inverse of the element a is denoted -a (minus a). The symbols and terminology
 * are borrowed from the additive groups of numbers: the ring of integers Z, the
 * field of rational numbers Q, the field of real numbers R, and the field of
 * complex numbers C are all additive groups.
 * 
 * In general, every ring and every field is an additive group.
