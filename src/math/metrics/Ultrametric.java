 * A metric is called an ultrametric if it satisfies the following stronger
 * version of the triangle inequality where points can never fall 'between'
 * other points:
 * 
 * For all x, y, z in X,
 * 
 * d(x, z) â‰¤ max(d(x, y), d(y, z))
 * 
 * in addition to that inherited by its being a {@link Metric}
 * 
 * d(x, z) <= d(x, y) + d(y, z)
