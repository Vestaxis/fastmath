  Abstract                 = {This paper studies the geometric convergence rate of a discrete renewal sequence to its limit. A general convergence rate is first derived from the hazard rates of the renewal lifetimes. This result is used to extract a good convergence rate when the lifetimes are ordered in the sense of new better than used or increasing hazard rate. A bound for the best possible geometric convergence rate is derived for lifetimes having a finite support. Examples demonstrating the utility and sharpness of the results are presented. Several of the examples study convergence rates for Markov chains.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the use of quantum noise to characterize many-body states of spin systems realized with ultracold atomic systems. These systems offer a wealth of experimental techniques for realizing strongly interacting many-body states in a regime with a large but not macroscopic number of atoms. In this regime, fluctuations of an observable such as the magnetization are discernible compared to the mean value. The full distribution function is experimentally relevant and encodes high order correlation functions that may distinguish various many-body states. We apply quantum noise analysis to the Ising model in a transverse field and find a distinctive even versus odd splitting in the distribution function for the transverse magnetization that distinguishes between the ordered, critical, and disordered phases. We also discuss experimental issues relevant for applying quantum noise analysis for general spin systems and the specific results obtained for the Ising model. },

  Abstract                 = {Ergodic theory is hard to study because it is based on measure theory, which is a technically difficult subject to master for ordinary students, especially for physics majors. Many of the examples are introduced from a different perspective than in other books and theoretical ideas can be gradually absorbed while doing computer experiments. Theoretically less prepared students can appreciate the deep theorems by doing various simulations. The computer experiments are simple but they have close ties with theoretical implications. Even the researchers in the field can benefit by checking their conjectures, which might have been regarded as unrealistic to be programmed easily, against numerical output using some of the ideas in the book. One last remark: The last chapter explains the relation between entropy and data compression, which belongs to information theory and not to ergodic theory. It will help students to gain an understanding of the digital technology that has shaped the modern information society.},

  Abstract                 = {Following G. M. Reed's definition of a $Q$-set, we define a $Q_A$-set to be any non-$\sigma$-discrete topological space with the property that each subset is (relatively) analytic (= Souslin-$\mathscr{F}$ set). Clearly every $Q$-set is a $Q_A$-set. The discrete irrational extension of the space of real numbers is an example of a first countable hereditarily paracompact (Hausdorff) $Q_A$-set which is not a $Q$-set. THEOREM. $(V = L)$ Let $X$ be a first countable normal space all of whose subsets are analytic. Then $X$ is $\sigma$-discrete if and only if the product of $X$ with the space of irrational numbers is normal. A new structural property of analytic sets is developed in order to utilize a proof technique due to Reed. Several corollaries are obtained on properties of completely additive-analytic families of sets in general metric spaces.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a point process Φ with the Polish phase space (X,X) and a system of σ-fields ℱ(x),x∈X, generated by Φ on certain sets (Γx)∈X. We define predictability for random processes indexed byX and for random measures onX and prove the existence and uniqueness of predictable and dual predictable projections under a regularity condition on Φ. ForX=ℝ 2 + and under monotonicity assumptions on the sets Γx we will identify the predictable projections of some simple processes as regular versions of certain martingales.},

Using this general dynamic model, which allows (a) intradaily returns to have different impacts and persistence on stock-return volatility, (b) return effects on volatility to be asymmetric, and (c) intradaily returns to follow conditional distributions with different fourth moments, we uncover important changes in return dynamics and conditional fourth moments following Big Bang and the 1987 crash not reported before.},

  Abstract                 = {An intertemporal model for the capital market is deduced from the portfolio selection behavior by an arbitrary number of investors who act so as to maximize the expected utility of lifetime consumption and who can trade continuously in time. Explicit demand functions for assets are derived, and it is shown that, unlike the one-period model, current demands are affected by the possibility of uncertain changes in future investment opportunities. After aggregating demands and requiring market clearing, the equilibrium relationships among expected returns are derived, and contrary to the classical capital asset pricing model, expected returns on risky assets may differ from the riskless rate even when they have no systematic or market risk.},

  Abstract                 = {The setting is a stationary, ergodic time series. The challenge is to construct a sequence of functions, each based on only finite segments of the past, which together provide a strongly consistent estimator for the conditional probability of the next observation, given the infinite past. Ornstein gave such a construction for the case that the values are from a finite set, and recently Algoet extended the scheme to time series with coordinates in a Polish space. The present study relates a different solution to the challenge. The algorithm is simple and its verification is fairly transparent. Some extensions to regression, pattern recognition and on-line forecasting are mentioned.},

  Abstract                 = {Let $A$ be a proper $H^\ast$-algebra and let $B$ be a Banach $^\ast$-algebra with an identity. A linear mapping $\varphi:B \rightarrow A$ is called a positive $A$-functional if $\sum_{i,j} a^\ast_i \varphi(x^\ast_i x_j)a_j$ is positive for all $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n \in B$ and $a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n \in A$. It is shown that for each positive $A$-functional $\varphi$ there exists a $^\ast$-representation $T$ of $B$ by $A$-linear operators on a Hilbert module $H$ such that $\varphi(x) = (f_0, Txf_0)$ for all $x \in B$ and some $f_0 \in H$. If $B$ is of the form $B = \{ \lambda e + x \mid \lambda \quad\text{complex}\quad, e\quad\text{is the (abstract) identity}\quad, x \in L^1(G) \}$ for some locally compact group $G$ then $\varphi$ has the form $\varphi(\lambda e + x) = \lambda \varphi(e) + \int_G x(t)p(t) dt$ for some generalized ($A$-valued) positive definite function $p$ on $G, x \in L^1(G)$.},

We show, for a general theory, that if we prescribe first a canonical complexification and second representation of the canonical commutation relations in which the real connection is diagonal, then there is only one choice of a holomorphic representation which incorporates the correct reality conditions and keeps the Hamiltonian (constraint) algebraically simple. We derive a canonical algorithm to obtain this holomorphic representation and in particular explicitly compute it for quantum gravity in terms of a Wick rotation transform.},
